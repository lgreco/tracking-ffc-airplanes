Project to track the airplanes of the Fox Flying Club

// Task Done - 10/1
- Found Google Maps SDK 
- Added Google Maps to repo
- - Plan: use folio to map data from .csv or .json files onto the open source mapping software
- (https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/getting_started.html)

The goal of this project is to build a web-based application that displays real-time locations and information about small aircraft using ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) data. The website will fetch live flight data from the OpenSky Network API and visualize aircraft positions on a map using Leaflet.js.
Users will be able to view aircraft details such as altitude, speed, and callsign, and filter to show only small or private planes. The system will consist of a Python Flask backend to retrieve and serve data, and a simple frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to demonstrate how open aviation data can be processed, filtered, and presented in a clear, interactive format.
